If you find yourself in a situation where you lack basic knowledge and your senior developer is expressing frustration or impatience, here are some steps you can take to improve the situation and foster a better working relationship:

1. **Communicate openly:**
   - Talk to your senior developer about your concerns and express your willingness to learn and improve. Communication is key to understanding each other's expectations.

2. **Seek clarification:**
   - Ask for specific feedback on what areas you need to improve and where you might be falling short. Understanding the expectations will help you focus on the right areas.

3. **Take responsibility:**
   - Acknowledge your shortcomings and take responsibility for your learning. Demonstrate a proactive attitude by expressing your commitment to addressing the gaps in your knowledge.

4. **Learn independently:**
   - Take the initiative to fill in the gaps in your knowledge. Use online resources, tutorials, and documentation to learn the basics. This shows your dedication and determination to improve.

5. **Ask for guidance:**
   - Seek guidance from your senior developer or other colleagues when you encounter difficulties. Don't hesitate to ask questions, but ensure that you've done your own research before seeking assistance.

6. **Set realistic goals:**
   - Break down your learning goals into smaller, achievable tasks. This can help you make progress incrementally and build confidence along the way.

7. **Document your progress:**
   - Keep track of what you've learned and the improvements you've made. This documentation can serve as a reference for both you and your senior developer, highlighting your commitment to growth.

8. **Request mentorship:**
   - If possible, ask your senior developer for mentorship. Having regular check-ins or guidance sessions can be beneficial for your learning and can also improve your working relationship.

9. **Show initiative:**
   - Demonstrate your eagerness to contribute by volunteering for tasks, even if they are small. This can help you gain practical experience and showcase your commitment to the team.

10. **Be patient with yourself:**
    - Learning takes time, and it's okay to make mistakes. Be patient with yourself and stay focused on continuous improvement.

Remember, it's essential to foster a positive and collaborative working environment. Both you and your senior developer share the common goal of delivering quality work, so working together constructively is key to overcoming challenges.
