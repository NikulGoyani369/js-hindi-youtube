Step 50
The fieldset element is used to group related inputs and labels together in a web form. fieldset elements are block-level elements, meaning that they appear on a new line.

Nest the Indoor and Outdoor radio buttons within a fieldset element, and don't forget to indent the radio buttons.

Step 51
The legend element acts as a caption for the content in the fieldset element. It gives users context about what they should enter into that part of the form.

Add a legend element with the text Is your cat an indoor or outdoor cat? above both of the radio buttons. 

<legend>: The Field Set Legend element
The<legend> HTML element represents a caption for the content of its parent <fieldset>.


Step 52
Next, you are going to add some new form input elements, so add another fieldset element directly below the current fieldset element.

Step 53
Add a legend element with the text What's your cat's personality? inside the second fieldset element.

Step 54
Forms commonly use checkboxes for questions that may have more than one answer. For example, here's a checkbox with the option of tacos: <input type="checkbox"> tacos.

Under the legend element you just added, add an input with its type attribute set to checkbox and give it the option of: Loving
        <legend>What's your cat's personality?</legend>
         <input type="checkbox"> Loving

Step 55
Add an id attribute with the value loving to the checkbox input.
 <input id="loving" type="checkbox"> Loving

 Step 56
There's another way to associate an input element's text with the element itself. You can nest the text within a label element and add a for attribute with the same value as the input element's id attribute.

Associate the text Loving with the checkbox by nesting only the text Loving in a label element and giving it an appropriate for attribute.

        <input id="loving" type="checkbox">
            <label for="loving"> 
             Loving
           </label>

Step 57
Add the name attribute with the value personality to the checkbox input element.

While you won't notice this in the browser, doing this makes it easier for a server to process your web form, especially when there are multiple checkboxes.

        <input id="loving" type="checkbox" name="personality"> 
        <label for="loving">Loving</label>

Step 58
Add another checkbox after the one you just added. The id attribute value should be lazy and the name attribute value should be the same as the last checkbox.

Also add a label element to the right of the new checkbox with the text Lazy. Make sure to associate the label element with the new checkbox using the for attribute.
