Step 50
The fieldset element is used to group related inputs and labels together in a web form. fieldset elements are block-level elements, meaning that they appear on a new line.

Nest the Indoor and Outdoor radio buttons within a fieldset element, and don't forget to indent the radio buttons.

Step 51
The legend element acts as a caption for the content in the fieldset element. It gives users context about what they should enter into that part of the form.

Add a legend element with the text Is your cat an indoor or outdoor cat? above both of the radio buttons. 

<legend>: The Field Set Legend element
The<legend> HTML element represents a caption for the content of its parent <fieldset>.


Step 52
Next, you are going to add some new form input elements, so add another fieldset element directly below the current fieldset element.

Step 53
Add a legend element with the text What's your cat's personality? inside the second fieldset element.

Step 54
Forms commonly use checkboxes for questions that may have more than one answer. For example, here's a checkbox with the option of tacos: <input type="checkbox"> tacos.

Under the legend element you just added, add an input with its type attribute set to checkbox and give it the option of: Loving
        <legend>What's your cat's personality?</legend>
         <input type="checkbox"> Loving

Step 55
Add an id attribute with the value loving to the checkbox input.
 <input id="loving" type="checkbox"> Loving

 Step 56
There's another way to associate an input element's text with the element itself. You can nest the text within a label element and add a for attribute with the same value as the input element's id attribute.

Associate the text Loving with the checkbox by nesting only the text Loving in a label element and giving it an appropriate for attribute.

        <input id="loving" type="checkbox">
            <label for="loving"> 
             Loving
           </label>

Step 57
Add the name attribute with the value personality to the checkbox input element.

While you won't notice this in the browser, doing this makes it easier for a server to process your web form, especially when there are multiple checkboxes.

        <input id="loving" type="checkbox" name="personality"> 
        <label for="loving">Loving</label>

Step 58
Add another checkbox after the one you just added. The id attribute value should be lazy and the name attribute value should be the same as the last checkbox.

Also add a label element to the right of the new checkbox with the text Lazy. Make sure to associate the label element with the new checkbox using the for attribute.

    <input id="lazy" type="checkbox" name="personality"> <label for="lazy">Lazy</label>

Step 59
Add a final checkbox after the previous one with an id attribute value of energetic. The name attribute should be the same as the previous checkbox.

Also add a label element to the right of the new checkbox with text Energetic. Make sure to associate the label element with the new checkbox.
    
    <input id="loving" type="checkbox" name="personality"> 
       <label for="loving">Loving<label>
    <input id="lazy" type="checkbox" name="personality"> 
        <label for="lazy">Lazy</label>
    <input id="energetic" type="checkbox" name="personality"> 
        <label for="energetic">Energetic</label>

Step 60
Like radio buttons, form data for selected checkboxes are name / value attribute pairs. While the value attribute is optional, it's best practice to include it with any checkboxes or radio buttons on the page.

Add a value attribute to each checkbox. For convenience, set each checkbox's value attribute to the same value as its id attribute.

    <fieldset>
        <legend>What's your cat's personality?</legend>
            <input id="loving" type="checkbox" name="personality" value="loving"> 
                <label for="loving">Loving</label>
            <input id="lazy" type="checkbox" name="personality" value="lazy"> 
                <label for="lazy">Lazy</label>
            <input id="energetic" type="checkbox" name="personality"value="energetic">     
                <label for="energetic"> Energetic</label>
    </fieldset>

Step 61
In order to make a checkbox checked or radio button selected by default, you need to add the checked attribute to it. There's no need to set a value to the checked attribute. Instead, just add the word checked to the input element, making sure there is space between it and other attributes.

Make the first radio button and the first checkbox selected by default.

        <fieldset>
            <legend>Is your cat an indoor or outdoor cat?</legend>
            <label>
                <input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="indoor"checked> Indoor
            </label>
            <label><input id="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="outdoor"> Outdoor
            </label>
        </fieldset>

            <fieldset>
                <legend>What's your cat's personality?</legend>
                <input id="loving" type="checkbox" name="personality"value="loving"checked>  
                <label for="loving">Loving</label>
                
                <input id="lazy" type="checkbox" name="personality" value="lazy"> 
                <label for="lazy">Lazy</label>
                
                <input id="energetic" type="checkbox" name="personality"value="energetic"> <label for="energetic"> Energetic</label>
            </fieldset>

Step 62
Now you will add a footer section to the page.

After the main element, add a footer element.
 </main>
    <footer>
    
    </footer>

Step 63
Nest a p element with the text No Copyright - freeCodeCamp.org within the footer element.
    <footer>
        <p>No CopyRight - freeCodeCamp.org</p>  
    </footer>


Step 64
Turn the existing freeCodeCamp.org text into a link by enclosing it in an anchor (a) element. The href attribute should be set to https://www.freecodecamp.org.

 <p>No Copyright - <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">freeCodeCamp.org</a></p>

Step 65
Notice that everything you've added to the page so far is inside the body element. All page content elements that should be rendered to the page go inside the body element. However, other important information goes inside the head element.

Add a head element above the body element.
        <html>
            <head> </head>
            <body>

Step 66
The title element determines what browsers show in the title bar or tab for the page.
Add a title element within the head element using the text below:
CatPhotoApp

        <head>
            <title>CatPhotoApp</title>
        </head>

Step 67
Notice that the entire contents of the page are nested within an html element. All other elements must be descendants of this html element.

Add the lang attribute with the value en to the opening html tag to specify that the language of the page is English.
    
    <html lang="en">

Step 68
All pages should begin with <!DOCTYPE html>. This special string is known as a declaration and ensures the browser tries to meet industry-wide specifications.
Add this declaration as the first line of the code.


Step 69
You can set browser behavior by adding self-closing meta elements in the head. Here's an example:

    <meta attribute="value">

Tell the browser to parse the markup into multiple languages by creating a meta element as a child of the head element. Set its charset attribute to UTF-8.
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>CatPhotoApp</title>
    </head>
